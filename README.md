# Machine Learning Honors Thesis: Predicting Degenerative Disc Disease in Chiropractic Patients Via Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my machine learning thesis project: Predicting Degenerative Disc Disease using Chiropractic Patient Data. In this thesis, I explore various machine learning techniques to better understand and predict Degenerative Disc Disease in patients using non-image data.

## Dataset

HIPAA compliant chiropractic patient data: [Degenerative Disc Patient Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHUIUC/ISU_Honors_Thesis_2021/main/Machine_Learning/MedicalData2.csv)

## Methodology

This deliverable of this thesis was produced using machine learning models implemented in Jupyter Notebook. Data collection information was read via CSV files of which captured data was stored.

## Results

Using a small data set, the trained model leveraging Random Forests Classifier was able to predict Degenerative Disc Disease in patients with an accuracy of ~80%. 

## Usage

To view the machine learning process and results, you can clone this repository and view the Jupyter Notebook file under the Machine Learning directory here: [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/DHUIUC/ISU_Honors_Thesis_2021/blob/main/Machine_Learning/DegenDiscPrediction.ipynb)
