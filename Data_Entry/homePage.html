	<h2>About this project</h2>
	
	<p>Artificial Intelligence has been of great benefit to many in the 
	   Medical field. One such area of interest has been diagnosing and 
	   recognizing potential medical health issues. This has been accomplished
	   using a variety of metrics, such as X-rays, blood measurements, and other
	   medical tests.</p>
	
	<p> One area of the medical fields where Artificial Intellgence has not been	
	    fully utilized is in the chiropractic field. As such, this project is an 
		attempt to introduce Artificial Intellgence to the chiropractic field.</p>
		
		
	<p> Using data provided by Realigned Chiropractic as well as Artificial 
		Intellgence, a model has been created to predict Degenerative Disc Disease.
		A patient can enter their non-identifiable medical metrics to be passed 
		through the AI model, to which a likelihood of Degenerative Disc Disease
		will be given.</p>
